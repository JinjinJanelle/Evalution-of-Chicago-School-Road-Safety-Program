# Background
On the condition that 800 of 3,000 vechile-pedestrian collisions involved children, Chicago government rolleded out Children's Safety Zone Program to protect children and other pedestrains by ticketing speed vialotions around school and park areas. The program started in late 2014 and kept running till now. To evaluate the program's effect on speeding behavior, I use the [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4) that records speed violation for each camera from 7/1/2014 to 4/11/2019.

## Finding1: The program is effective: the number of speed violations has been decreasing over the years.
The biggest question is if the program is effective on slowing down motorists and reducing speeding behaviors. Thus, I plotted the average violations by week and found the overall decreasing trend. To better illustrate the trend, I added a trend line and it confirmed my initial impression.
