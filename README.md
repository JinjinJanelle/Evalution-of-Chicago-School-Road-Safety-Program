# Background
On the condition that 800 of 3,000 vechile-pedestrian collisions involved children, Chicago government rolleded out Children's Safety Zone Program to protect children and other pedestrains by ticketing speed vialotions around school and park areas. The program started in late 2014 and kept running till now. To evaluate the program's effect on speeding behavior, I use the [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4) that records speed violation for each camera from 7/1/2014 to 4/11/2019.

## Finding 1: The program is effective: the number of speed violations has been decreasing over the years.
The biggest question is if the program is effective on slowing down motorists and reducing speeding behaviors. Thus, I plotted the average violations by week and found the decreasing trend over the years. To better illustrate the trend, I added a trend line and it confirmed my initial impression.

The declining trend indicates that the program is effective on speed violation behaviors. The message to the mayor is clear: with the program, children's safety on the road around schools and parks is enhanced. Also, so far, since the average violations by week is always on the decline, there is no evidence that the program has reached its limit on the effectiveness. The program should keep running under current polices and actions. If, in the future, the declining trend stops, the city may start additional acts to improve the safety.

## Finding 2: The program is effective: the number of speed violations has been decreasing over the years.
